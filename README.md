# Program-structure-proj2
Source of my ICS 212 projects

This is the source of my project assigned for my Program Structure class taught by Ravi Narayan at UH Manoa.
It is a simple database like application modeled after something like a simple bank customer database. It reads in records stored in a specified format from a text file, allows the user to read, write and modify existing records and addition of new records or deletion of existing records. When the program is exited it writes the changes into the text file storing the data.
